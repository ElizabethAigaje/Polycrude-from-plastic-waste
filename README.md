# Polycrude-from-plastic-waste
This repository contains the scripts for assessing the economic viability of polycrude production from plastic waste via hydrocracking.
Polycrude is an intermediate product (long-chain hydrocarbon) aimed to be integrated with refinery operations for further processing.
This project leverages existing packages such as qsdsan and biosteam to create a unified framework for simulation, TEA, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.
